Goal
//Create a web portfolio to showcase myself and projects

files: landing.tsx, aboutMe.tsx, projects.tsx, and contact.tsx


For all pages:
    set up the navbar using charkra ui and link each page to the navbar, this will be used the same way on all pages
        also make it so whichever page you are on, the button for that page is highlighted

    add an animated background to each page

landing.tsx:
    Add text to introduce myself and my page
    center it on the page and adjust the font

aboutMe.tsx:
    Text to write about my background and my experience
    center text and adjust font 

projects.tsx:
    I am choosing to showcase 6 different projects
    I display them in a column going down with a note under each one displaying what languages are used and what year i madde the projects
    Make them clickable, i think we are using azure to push them all and then we can link them on our portfolio to access, so just an onclick most likely to take you to the page
    If I want the page to scroll down, ill also have to figure out how to adjust the animated background

contact.tsx:
    A google form will be used to contact me, it can be embeded into the code
    In the form, the user can enter their name, email, and a message to me from within my portfolio that I should recieve in my email
        (or a link if embeding doesnt work out the way I think it will)
    Also still note my email at the bottom of the page in case someone would rather just email me
